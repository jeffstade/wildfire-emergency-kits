Wildfire risk app

With climate change, the State of California is exhibiting increased threat of wildfire. No doubt fire risk is a function of climate and weather, but also a host of time-invariant, spatial variables such as vegetation, elevation, land cover and more. Your challenge is to integrate [Californiaâ€™s Fire Perimeter data](https://frap.fire.ca.gov/frap-projects/fire-perimeters/) for 2-3 or years with [other fire data, vegetation, land cover data, elevation data and other](https://frap.fire.ca.gov/mapping/gis-data/), to estimate fire risk. Can you use spatial cross-validation to validate this model?

There are multiple possible model approaches here. For an app, granted none of us are forestry experts, but can you design a fire management app that prioritizes where naturalist should clear brush, do burns, etc. Maybe, this is an app aimed at insurance companies or homeowners?
